          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Before becoming interested in web devlopment, I went to West Virginia University and got a dual bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I am now pursuing a career in web development to add to my skillset and gain more flexibility in my career.</p>
